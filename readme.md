## Usage

Require it within your module:

the RFC 4648 Spec where '+' is encoded as '-' and '/' is encoded as '_'. 
The padding character '=' is removed.

``` javascript
  var randomURLSafeBase64;
  crypto.randomBytes(32, function(err, buf) {
    if (err) {
      throw err;
      return;
    };
    randomURLSafeBase64 = URLSafeBase64.encode(buf);
  });
```

### .decode(string)

Decodes a URL Safe Base64 string as a buffer.

``` javascript
var someURLSafeBase64 = '';
URLSafeBase64.decode(someURLSafeBase64); // returns a buffer
```

### .validate(string)

Validates a string if it is URL Safe Base64 encoded.

``` javascript
  var validURLSafeBase64 = '';
  URLSafeBase64.validate(validURLSafeBase64); // returns true

  var invalidURLSafeBase64 = '/+=='
  URLSafeBase64.validate(invalidURLSafeBase64); // returns false
```
